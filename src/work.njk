            <p class="pb-7 max-w-screen-sm">In 2022, I rejoined the Online Store team to help evolve the theme design system and the way we use it to enable the team to produce a wider variety of designs, and give our merchants more tools to build their stores.
Following the systems work, we redesigned how merchants add new sections to their store to make it easier and faster to customize their storefronts.</p>

In 2017 we shipped the first version of Shopify’s design system &#8212; Polaris. Between 2018 and 2020 I led the team through a complete refresh of our design language.</p>
